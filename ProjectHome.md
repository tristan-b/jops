JOPS is comprised of a particle system library and a java Swing editor.

The file format consists of a zip file containing the xml description of the system, therefore making it really small, generally just a few KB's.

I use JIBX for XML binding, making the loading and saving process really fast, even for more complex systems.

Xith3D, a java 3D scenegraph, has integration code to support JOPS.
